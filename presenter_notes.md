Things That Spin
================

* "Today I want to talk about things that spin. Spinning objects can act in
  very unexpected ways."
* **Take out coin**. 
  "For instance, this coin, when at rest, tends to want to  over. Actually, 
  this coin is probably too small for everyone to see. Let me get a larger one."
* **Take out Euler disk**. 
  "This coin, when at rest, tends to want to fall over. Now since its edge is 
  so wide, it's not as unstable as an actual coin so I will demonstrate this by
  starting it at an angle. And I'm on the carpet because it's very heavy and I
  don't want to damage my table."
* "However, if we spin the coin..." 
  **Spin the Euler's disk**. 
  "It doesn't immediately fall over. That's interesting. It appears the act of
  spinning makes something want to stay upright."
* "You can see this when spinning a top." 
  **Take out top.**
  "When at rest, the top wants to lay on its side."
  **Demonstrate**.
  "But when you spin it, it tends to stay upright."
  **Demonstrate**.
* "By the way, does anyone know how to tell the difference between a raw egg
  and a hard cooked one?"
  **Take out eggs**.
  **Field answers**.
  Answer: "The hard cooked egg will spin easily. The raw egg will not."
  **Demonstrate**.
  "However, once you've spun the raw egg enough, it will want to keep
  spinning to the point where you can stop it, and it will start up again."
  **Demonstrate**.
* "If you spin an egg-shaped object fast enough, something interesting
  happens."
  **Demonstrate with plastic egg**.
* "This is because the center of mass is not directly over the center of
  rotation. When the egg is vertical, the center of mass and center of
  rotation line up, and the egg is much happier."
* **Take out rattleback celt**.
  "This object is also ellipsoidal like an egg, but its center of mass
  and center of rotation line up, so it will happily spin horizontally."
  **Spin counterclockwise**
  **Spin clockwise**.
  "...Just only in one direction, apparently."
* "Would you like to figure out why?"
  If yes: **Take out dynamic celt**
  "Here's a bigger version, with this large metal bar added to the top.
  Let's set the bar so that it is over the center of the ellipse and see
  what happens."
  **Spin counter clockwise**.
  **Spin clockwise**.
  "Now let's set the bar so that it's offset a little and see what happens."
  **Spin towards weight**.
  **Spin away from weight**.
  "Let's try it with the weight on the other side for completeness."
  **Spin towards weight**.
  **Spin away from weight**.
  "So what do you think is causing this directional favoritism?"
  **Field answers**.
* **Take out tippe top**.
  "Here's another top."
  **Spin tippe top**.
  "That's unexpected..."
* "So what have we learned about spinning?"
  **Field answers**.
  Answers: 
    * Spinning exerts a force.
    * The force is proportional to the rate of spin.
* "If we were to spin something really fast, we would expect the force to be 
  quite strong."
  **Take out gyroscope**.
  **Balance on a string or tip of pen. Perturb**.
  **Suspend from one edge on the string**.
  **Other gyroscope tricks?**
* "I would like us to explore what it is about spinning that creates force.
  At your desks is a zippy bag with some supplies. We're going to do some
  experiments by making a top."
* "First, get the toothpick. Try spinning it on its tip. Does it stay up?"
* "Next, attach one square of paper to the toothpick through the hole in
  the center about 1/3rd up the toothpick and try to spin it. What happened?"
* "Add another square of paper, and give it a spin. Did it spin longer?
  Did it appear more balanced?"
* Repeat for squares 3 - 5. Discuss between each spin.
* "What do we think is required to generate this stabilizing force when
  spinning?"
